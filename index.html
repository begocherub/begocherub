            <p1>Hey! I'm Bego√±a, a PhD student at University College London. My research focuses on language learning in infancy and childhood, so
                I have a lot of experience working with babies and children of all ages. I have been babysitting for 5 years, in 
            central London, mostly for multilingual families. I speak fluent English, Spanish, Catalan 
            and some German (B1 level). I am also DBS-checked and first-aid trained!
            </p>

            I really enjoy spending time with children and helping them learn! I have a flexible schedule so if you're in need of a babysitter, 
            don't hesitate to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>. I'd love to help you and your family and get to know your children!
