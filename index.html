            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p1>Hey! I'm Begonia, a PhD student at University College London.  
                <br>I have a lot of experience working with babies and children of all ages, both as a researcher and as a 
            babysitter. 
            <br> I have been babysitting for 5 years, in 
            central London. I speak fluent English, Spanish, Catalan 
            and some German (B1 level). 
            <br>I am also DBS-checked and first-aid trained!
            </p>

            I really enjoy spending time with children and helping them learn! I have a flexible schedule so if you're in need of a babysitter, 
            don't hesitate to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>. I'd love to help you and your family and get to know your children!
